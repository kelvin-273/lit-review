\begin{abstract}

In this study we hope to show whether or not it is possible to learn where to find good solutions for combinatorial optimisation problems.
Many studies have looked at using machine learning as a means of finding better approximations for the components of the algorithms that solve these problems, but so far, no study has considered using feasible solutions to guide the search.% TODO: change this to learning from feasible solutions.
The proposed research aims at showing how much structural information can be extracted from the solutions space of optimisation problems under total omniscience, and then we will show whether the information can be learned without omniscience.
