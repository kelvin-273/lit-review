\begin{abstract}

In this study we aim to determine whether it is possible to learn where to find good new solutions for combinatorial optimisation problems using a sample set of feasible solutions.
Although Machine Learning has been used to improve components of discrete optimisation algorithms, none of these approaches use feasible solutions to do so.
The proposed research aims at quantifying the information that can be extracted from the solution space of optimisation problems.
Our research starts by considering the case where all solutions are known, in order to determine to what extent optimisation algorithms can be improved in this setup.
We will evaluate to what extent information from feasible solutions can be exploited by the branching component of Mixed-Integer Programming solvers.
